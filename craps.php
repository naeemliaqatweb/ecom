<h3 class="are">There are 3 stragtegies of Crap</h3>
<h2 class="pt-3">Crap Strategy 1</h2>
<p class="background ">Many People believe that this is the best possible betting structure for low breakers who play the card line. You can judge it by your self by watching on youtube which will be best option to learn the Crap Gaming .</p>
<h2>Crap Strategy 2 </h2>       
<p class="background ">The long haul in craps 30% of craps games are decided on the come-out roll . Just, the shooter rolls a 7 or 11 or a craps number 2, 3, or 12. “So keep that in mind” 7 makes an presence once every 6 rolls so it is quite likely that a shooter can rope 2 or 3 7’s together on the come-out bowl. Next Game again 7, and after winning we are into the third come out roll of the shooter who has yet to roll a fact. <br>
Much more ways to roll a 7 than any other number. Do see the Chart:<br>
(Left & Right) Die<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
5- 2 , 2-5 , 3-4 , 4-3 , 6-1 , 1-6</small></p>
<p class="background ">Six more ways that the dice can plot and show a “seven.” No one of the other number has different ways to roll.
After winning stike starting a new game with  come-out roll with $15 on the pass line and $6 on 3-way craps is how 15-6 begins. So it may think that net gain would be only $27  after roll of seven thrice times in a row because may be we lose the $6 three-way craps bet three times for a loss of ($18). then won $45 if we had only bet the pass line. 
Is that the way $15-6 will do a better , don’t think so <br>
<p class="background ">The first come-out roll of 7, we bet $3 on hop the 7’s, which is also called hop the reds The second come out 7, I won $13 from my $3 hop bet. Why $13? The hop the 7 bet compensations 15 to 1 on a 7, there are 3 types of 7’s: a 6 1, 5 2, 4 3. That game only considers 3 ways to roll a 7 (4-3, 5-2, 6-1 and overlooks what each die is under achievement ), paying $15 for any $1 on the 7 loss the $ on the other 2 ways to make a $7. Many second come-out roll of a 7 was a (5 2), which is the lost of $1 bet on the 6-1 and the (5 2). So that’s $13 more to add to the winning strikes from the pass line bet of serveral minutes in the loss of the 3 way craps bet.
After second roll of a 7 on the come-out, we have to press the hop bet by $3 again to a $6 hop bet. Then third come-out roll, a (6 1) should give us $26. After 3 Come-Out Rolls of 7, we will win </p>
<div class="border  border-top-success rounded py-3 px-3">
<label class="bg-success col">1- We won $9 from the pass line bet of $15 $15-$6 on the first Come-Out roll bet and win 15-6.</label>
<label class="bg-warning col">2. We won $13 on the “Hop the 7’s” bet on the second Come-Out roll.</label>
<label class="bg-info col">3. We won $26 on the “Hop the 7’s” bet on the third Come-Out roll.</label>
<label class="bg-primary col">So you collected $18 from the pass line on come-out rolls two and three ($30 to $12).</label>
<label class="bg-white col">So my total win is more than $48 ($9+$13+26 and $18)- WOW and this will on and on .</label>
</div>
<h2 class="pt-2">Crap Strategy 3</h2>      
<h5 class="text-warning">SUPER HEDGE Strategy</h5>
<p class="background ">1-We have $6 on the Don’t Pass line and the point rolled is a 4 or a 10. In Super Hedge the we places the 10 or the 4 for $5. We will win $1 on a 7-out or the player will win $3 if a 4 or 10 is rolled. If a 7 is rolled, the $5 on the point is deducted from the $6 on the DON’T PASS BET. If we get the point, the 4 or the 10 subtract the loss of the Don’t Pass Bet, $6, from the win $9 for a net win of $3 and this cannot lose the betting.</p>

<p class="background ">2- And if we have $11 on the Don’t Pass line the point number rolled is a 10 or 4, put the 4 or 10 for $10. We will win $1 on a 7-out/$8 on the concern number being rolled. Super Hedge ensures a win for us for point numbers, the (5/9).<br>
3. And then $6 on the Don’t Pass line put the 5/9 for $5. Out of 7 gives a $1 win to reach 5/9 rolled makes for us for $1 winning .
4. After that $6 on the Don’t Pass line, put 6/8 for $6 may be we breaks even on a 7-out or win for $1 if  point is made as a 6/8 pays$7.</p></div>
