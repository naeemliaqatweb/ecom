		<p>Poker is a game of aggression. In the basics of the game, you have to learn when you need to up the aggression on the table.</p>
		<p>Most of the players are simply too careful. They check when they should bet and call when they should raise the bet. In opening hands pairs or a hand made up of A-K /A J, play more aggressively than you might think you should. These are great cards to be starting out with, Make them pay to see those cards, and push as many people out of the pot as early as possible. With six people in a pot, your base odds of a win.</p>
		<p>If you raise soon you find yourself being pushed around by stronger players who know you are in under pressure. When you do bet big, other players will immediately know you hold a strong hand and everyone will quickly fold.</p>
		<p>Aggressive play builds big confidence of your winning hand, your best move is to make it more interesting.</p>
		<p>When you don’t have to worry about your own hand, you can focus more closely on everyone else hands so that you must be vigilant and then use your aggression to go after your check.</p>

		<p>You must play with the player not with your cards. That is the fancy way of saying that poker is based on the situation which you created. A-A is a bizarre hand, but if another player holds K-K, your A-A have a chance to win. Imagine you hold A-9 while the other guy’s on J-J. The flop comes up.</p>
		<p>Do not let of losses (known as bad beats) it discourage you. That requires playing thousands and thousands of hands in a real game setting. It's the only way to firmly grasp you an expert.</p>
		<p>When required, and study the table like it's your favorite movie. This will keep your play in check and resist the urge to go “on tilt”. Don't try to make up losses with foolish bets. </p>

		<p>You must develop your skills while you will learn a lot from both wins and losses,you can also learn a lot more by reading blogs and books about poker strategy. Online is also a great way to improve your skills and knowledge. Just be sure to choose the right table. “Play money” tables are likely to be chock full of amateurs that aren’t playing a serious game.</p>
