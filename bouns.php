<h2>HOUSE WAY STRATEGY</h2>
<p>To beat the house way strategy, Think about it. How dealer play his hand? Would he split his two pairs or not? Would he place a pair in the front hand of you or not? Or would he simply leave them both in the back hand? What about he or she has absolutely no pair, whats your stance then? Well, if you’re worried about all matters, then have a look at our Pai Gow Poker Strategy</p>
