				<h2>Roulette Strategy Steps</h2>



<p>Find a table with a small minimum bet and a high maximum bet. Put small wager on black or red; even or odd Keep the winnings and bet the same small wager again If you lose, double your original wager and put it on the same bet again.If you win the second wager, keep your winnings and wager the original small bet If you lose again, double the wager and try again.Repeat this process until all the money is gone or you reach the max bet watch out for that gambler because one color has won 100 times in a row.</p> 
<h2>Reverse Roulette Strategy</h2>
<p>Instead of raising your bets when you lose, the point is to increase them when you win and lower them after losses. Capitalize on hot streaks and keep your losses to a minimum during the game.Play on roulette table with a high max bet and a small min. Bet a small amount on black or red even or odd keep your wager on the same spot on the table until you hit it if you hit your bet and win then do a little double your bet on the same spot and keep doubling your bet on winning.In case of losing come back to your original bet.
Biggest disadvantage to this roulette winning strategy is timing. The Reverse Strategy is really risky because as soon as you lose, you lose your entire earnings. </p>
<h2>D-Alembert Strategy:</h2>
<p>Place a small starting wager on black or red , even or odd and increase your wager by one after a loss, & less it by one after a win and win or loose or loose. As many wins as losses please walk away because in losing streak, stick tight until the winning picks up and equals your losses. And make continue playing until your wins equal your total losses that’s the only formulae.When you have done with equal number of wins and losses left the game and go home with your earnings. The disadvantage to this strategy is simply keeping track of your number of wins and losses.</p>
<h2>E-Fibonacci Roulette Strategy:</h2>
<p>Start with a small bet on black or red If you lose, increase your bet by going down the sequence. If you started with a bet of $1 and you lose, bet another $1. When you win, move back 2 numbers in the sequence and bet that amount. </p>
