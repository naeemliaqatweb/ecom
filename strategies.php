			<p class="text-white text-center">First of all you need to know about baccarat strategy.</p>
			<p>What is baccarat ?</p>
			<p>Baccarat is not a game of skill but of luck. After you’ve placed a bet/on the banker, the player, or a tie, the game is out of your control. If you’re new to the game, we recommend that you study the rules of Baccarat first understandings.</p>
			<h2>UNDERSTANDING OF NUMBERS </h2>
			<p>The best baccarat strategy is to understand the numbers in the game. 
			A) House Edge
			The lowest house edge you will find in all casino games alongside craps.  The casino has only almost 1.4 percent advantage on bets on banker, which is one of the better odds you’ll find both online and in live online casinos. </p>

			<p>Some of other mathematical facts about baccarat:</p>

			<p>The odds of a player's hand winning are just slightly lesser than the odds of the banker’s hand losing. The player's hand will success 44.62 % of the time. The banker’s hand will lose 45.85 % of the time.</p>
			<p> Ties are a scarcity, but they do occur. The chances for a tie in baccarat are 9.53 % and the payoff for a tie is 8 to 1, but the house has a massive benefit on these bets.</p>
			<p> If you aspect out the tie, then the banker's hand wins about 51 % of the time. This 1% is a very borderline advantage, but it's slightly better than coin-flip odds. If you're unsure what bet to make, bet on the banker's hand to win.</p>
			<h2> BACCARAT BETS AND ODDS</h2>
			<p>The lowest bets at the mini-baccarat table are usually around $25, and at the bigger table around $100. Although there are some bets with a absurdly low house edge, you could possibly lose a lot quite quickly because of the slightly bigger than average minimum betting amount. Understanding the odds will help the loss with less rate.
			Choose from one of three bets: The most vital baccarat odds to know edge the tie bet. While 8-to-1 seems alluring, the reality is that the true odds of a tie are much longer than this, and this bet has a house edge of over 14 percent.  
			The banker knows what he has to beat before determining whether to draw a card. However, a player who wins a banker bet atlest pay a 5% commission to the house and this evens the odds out a bit.                    
			Even with the five percent commission, the baccarat house edge on banker bets is 1.17 percent as opposed to 1.36 percent on player bets. This means there is really no reason to ever bet on the player. </p>

			<h2>KEEP SCORE BACCARAT STRATEGY</h2>
			<p>Most of the players use the sheets to track the wins and losses of player vs. banker and try to bet on "trends."  The reality is that in the long term odds have little effect on short term results and the banker will beat the player a little more than half the time even if the banker has earned the last ten or 20 hands in a row. </p>

			<p>Don’t</p>

			<p>Start betting without knowing the rules first.</p>
			 <p>Start playing until you check the smallest bets. Baccarat has a higher lowest bet than most games, and it differs from casino to casino. Make sure you are aware what it is before placing your chips!</p>
			<p>Place bet after bet on a tie. Ties only occur about once every 9.5 hands so you could waste a lot of money waiting for this outcome.</p>
			<p>Don’t continue betting for a long time while you are on a winning streak, as you are more likely to lose it all on a lost bet.</p>
